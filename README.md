# Laravel based Webshop
## Intro
This project was meant as an exercise to further develop my expertise in the Laravel framework and PHP in general by developing a working frontend webshop with some backend functionality.

## Application
This application has the following:
* Authentication
* Products
  * Index containing all products in the Database
* Basic Shopping Cart
  * Stored in the Laravel's session storage
  * Index page containing all products selected by the User
* Minimalistic Checkout
  * Checkout by use of the Stripe API
  * Payment method: VISA
* Orders
  * Index containing all the logged in User's Orders

## Conclusion
This project is far from perfect as it was an exercise to further develop myself and more accurately to learn how to perform payments.
